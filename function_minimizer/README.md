Minimization of the function is done in two steps

The first step uses gradient descent with the "stepwise crushing method" (1st at the bottom of page 40 of attached book) to select the next step

The second step uses the Newtonian multidimensional minimization method with the "golden section" method (4th at the top of page 41 of attached book) to select the next step
